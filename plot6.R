### Question 6
#
# Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City
# with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County,
# California (fips == "06037"). Which city has seen greater changes
# over time in motor vehicle emissions?

# Fetch the data
source('get_data.R')

library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)

# Read in the source data
emissions_data <- readRDS("data/summarySCC_PM25.rds")
source_codes   <- readRDS("data/Source_Classification_Code.rds")

# To determine what is meant by 'motor vehicle sources' we examine the source-codes
# data (and documentation, found here: http://www3.epa.gov/ttn/chief/net/2008neiv3/2008_neiv3_tsd_draft.pdf)
# For our purposes, we'll use the "On-road â€“ all Diesel and Gasoline vehicles" information
# (see page 112 of the linked report, section 4.6).
# This consists of 4 EI.Sector codes, which are prefixed with "Mobile - On-Road"

mv_sources <- source_codes[grepl('^Mobile - On-Road', as.character(source_codes$EI.Sector)), ]

# This gives us 1138 motor-vehicle source codes (across 4 EI.Sector's)
# We're interested in the change of particulate output across these codes for
# only Baltimore City and Los Angeles County, so we'll need to filter the main list to the correct
# codes, then aggregate by year.

                                      emissions_data$SCC %in% mv_sources$SCC, ]

mv_source_emissions$location <- as.factor(mv_source_emissions$location)

mv_source_emissions_by_year$year_factor  <- as.factor(mv_source_emissions_by_year$year)

# We want to see the change over time, and this time there are multiple factors
# Additionally, the numbers for LA County are MUCH LARGER than those for Baltimore City.

### RESULT
# Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City
# with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County,
# California (fips == "06037"). Which city has seen greater changes
# over time in motor vehicle emissions?
#
# We can see from the plots that thought the total motor vehicle emissions
# are much, much higher in LA County, the actual volume of change is similar
# to that in Baltimore -- but in the opposite direction (in 2008, LA produced about
# 200 more tons than they did in 1999, while Baltimore produced about 200 less).
# As a percentage of their previous emissions levels, Baltimore's reduction
# over the period is far greater than the increase seen in LA.
